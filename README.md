## Introduction
This project is a practical demonstration of closed-loop control using a PID controller to maintain the position of a ball on a horizontal rod. It combines mechanical design with real-time control algorithms and feedback from sensors to achieve precise positioning.

The system consists of:
- A horizontal rod actuated by a servo motor.
- Two ultrasonic sensors that detect the ball's position on the rod.
- A PID controller implemented in an STM32 microcontroller to dynamically adjust the rod's angle.

This README explains the structure, operation, and technical details of the project, along with how to set it up and run the system.

- **Dynamic PID Adjustment:** Users can tune the PID controller to optimize system performance, minimizing overshoot, rise time, and steady-state error.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors for Feedback:** Two ultrasonic sensors are used for precise position detection of the ball on the rod.
- **MATLAB Visualizations:** MATLAB is used for graphing and analyzing the system response under different PID configurations.

## Project Layers

### Control System Layer
This layer is responsible for the real-time control of the rod using the STM32 microcontroller. The control system is built around a PID algorithm that adjusts the motor's position based on the error between the ball's current position and the desired position.

### Sensor Feedback Layer
The ball's position is detected using ultrasonic sensors. The sensors send distance data to the STM32, which processes it to compute the position error. This error is then used by the PID controller to adjust the rod's angle.

### Motor Actuation Layer
The motor is driven by a servo driver that receives commands from the STM32 microcontroller. The STM32 sends PWM signals to control the motor's angle and adjust the rod in response to ball movement.

### MATLAB Analysis Layer
The data collected during the system's operation is plotted in MATLAB. MATLAB is used to visualize the response of the system with different PID parameters and analyze the systemâ€™s performance, including overshoot, rise time, and settling time.

## Explain more about the PID Control
The PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is the heart of this system. It continuously computes an error value as the difference between the desired and actual ball position and adjusts the motor position to minimize this error.

- **Proportional (P):** Determines the reaction to the current error.
- **Integral (I):** Accounts for past errors to eliminate steady-state error.
- **Derivative (D):** Predicts future error based on the rate of change, helping reduce overshoot and oscillations.

Different PID coefficients were tested, and MATLAB was used to visualize the system's response under different configurations. You can find detailed plots in the `plots/` folder.

## Adjust PID Parameters:
We adjusted the PID parameters through trial and error. The optimal values found for the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative coefficients are:
- \( K_p = 8 \)
- \( K_i = 1 \)
- \( K_d = 11 \)

These values were determined to minimize overshoot, reduce rise time, and ensure stable steady-state performance. The system supports real-time tuning for better control, allowing for continuous adjustments until optimal values are confirmed.
